I love `dwm`. However, I want to minimize the number of shortcuts for it so that I have more shortcuts for other programs. My idea is to use a `PORT` (`Ctrl-W` or `Meta-W`) to control all workspaces and windows. After pressing the `PORT`, there will appear a command prompt for user to type in the command they want: 
- changing window-mode in a workspace (`float`, `tile`, `mono`),
- moving windows to a new workspace, 
- resizing windows within a workspace (the current approach for `float` mode in `dwm` is awesome), 
- show all windows that are currently open together with their corresponding workspace.
